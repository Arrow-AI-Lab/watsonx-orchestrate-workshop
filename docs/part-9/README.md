On this screen, you can add other utterances to trigger this skillflow-based action, or you can just 
leave the default utterance, which is the name of the skill-based action itself. When you’re done, 
click the disk icon (1) to the top right to save your action. Then close it by clicking (2).

You should now see the AI-guided action you created earlier, along with the new Skillflow-based action 
you just created.
