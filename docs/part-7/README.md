# Connecting skills to AI assistant

In this section, you'll make your GenAI skills, custom Salesforce skills, and Outlook skills available to the Skillflow Builder and AI Assistant.
 
We will first do this for the personal profile that manages skills availability for the skillflow builder, and then for our AI Assistant profile. 

The current way of managing skills availability is recognised as sub-optimal and is being revised/reworked by IBM.
